### The Scenario

You're a developer at "Future Gadgets," an online electronics store. The checkout system has just handed you a raw `shoppingCart` data object. This data is a bit messy because it comes from a legacy system. Your task is to build a "Cart Processing Pipeline." This pipeline will take the raw cart data, clean it up, calculate all the necessary totals, and finally generate a formatted receipt ready to be displayed to the customer.

Here is the raw data you'll be working with. Notice the inconsistenciesâ€”some prices are strings, some items might be invalid, and so on. This is intentional. Real-world data is rarely perfect.

```javascript
// --- INITIAL DATA ---

const shoppingCart = [
  {
    product: 'Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones',
    price: '99.99', // Price is a string
    quantity: 2,
    category: 'audio',
    taxable: true,
    shippingCost: 5.00
  },
  {
    product: 'Smartphone X Pro',
    price: 899.50,
    quantity: 1,
    category: 'electronics',
    taxable: true,
    shippingCost: 7.25
  },
  {
    product: 'Vintage Vinyl Record',
    price: 24.50,
    quantity: 1,
    category: 'music',
    taxable: false, // Tax-exempt
    shippingCost: 3.50
  },
  {
    product: 'Data Cable',
    price: '12.00',
    quantity: 3,
    category: 'accessories',
    taxable: true,
    shippingCost: 2.00
  },
  {
    product: 'Extended Warranty', // No price, should be ignored
    quantity: 1,
    category: 'service',
    taxable: false,
    shippingCost: 0
  },
   {
    product: 'Smart Home Hub',
    price: 149.00,
    quantity: 1,
    category: 'electronics',
    taxable: true,
    shippingCost: 8.00
  }
];

// The sales tax rate
const TAX_RATE = 0.0825; // 8.25%
```

### Your Challenge

Your task is to implement the following parts in sequence. Each part builds on the last.

#### **Part 1: Data Normalization and Line Totals**

Before we can do any calculations, we need to clean and standardize the data.

**Goal:** Create a function `normalizeAndCalculateLineItems` that takes the raw `shoppingCart` array as input. This function should produce a **new array** of "line items" where:
1.  Any items without a valid `price` are filtered out.
2.  The `price` for each item is converted to a number.
3.  A new property, `lineTotal`, is calculated for each item (`price` * `quantity`).

**Key test:** The original `shoppingCart` array must **not** be modified.

#### **Part 2: Calculating the Order Summary**

Now that you have clean data, you can perform the core business logic calculations.

**Goal:** Create a function `calculateOrderSummary` that takes the normalized line items array from Part 1 as input. This function should return a **single object** that contains the following calculated values:
1.  `subtotal`: The sum of all `lineTotal` values.
2.  `totalShipping`: The sum of all `shippingCost` values.
3.  `totalTax`: The total tax to be charged. Tax is calculated **only** on `taxable` items. The tax for a single item is `lineTotal * TAX_RATE`.
4.  `grandTotal`: The final amount the customer has to pay (`subtotal` + `totalShipping` + `totalTax`).

#### **Part 3: Generating the Customer Receipt**

With the final numbers calculated, it's time to create the user-facing output.

**Goal:** Create a function `generateReceiptHTML` that takes the normalized line items (from Part 1) and the order summary object (from Part 2) as input.
1.  The function should generate a single HTML string.
2.  This string should contain a list of the products, showing the quantity, product name, and the `lineTotal` for each.
3.  It should also display the `subtotal`, `totalShipping`, `totalTax`, and the final `grandTotal`.
4.  Finally, create a simple `displayReceipt` function. This function will call your other functions in the correct order, get the final HTML string, and insert it into the DOM inside the `<div id="receipt-container"></div>`. It should be appended, not overwrite any existing content.

Here's a basic HTML file you can use to see your output:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your Order Receipt</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: monospace; padding: 20px; }
        #receipt-container { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; max-width: 400px; }
        ul { list-style: none; padding: 0; }
        li, p { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 5px; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Future Gadgets</h1>
    <div id="receipt-container">
        <p><strong>Thank you for your order!</strong></p>
    </div>
    
    <script src="your-script.js"></script> 
</body>
</html>
```
